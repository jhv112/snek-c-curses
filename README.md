# SNEK

Simple game of Snake in C using standard IO, written ca. 2017-12-31.

## Building from source

The C file is known to build with GCC (MinGW) on a Windows machine.
The BAT file should "just werk" for such a setup.
No libraries or other external dependencies are required.
Building for and running on UNIX/Linux is untested.
